have a fuller bust, hips + thighs \n","Emphasize your waist with figure-hugging styles if you ’re an \n","hourglass.

Rectangle body type  \n"," You ’re not particularly curvy \n"," Your shoulders and hip measurements \n","are nearly the same \n"," Your waist is straight up and down \n"," Your weight is fairly evenly distributed \n","throughout your body \n"," \n","Wear voluminous tops and skinny jeans if you have a straight body type.  To dress \n","a rectangular body shape , choose clothes that highlight your arms and legs. By wearing \n","bold, patterned tops and figure-hugging jeans, you also break up your silhouette  and \n","help create curves along your body.  \n"," Go for shirts and dresses with ruffles and frills to add texture, volume, and \n","femininity to your figure. A dress with a lot of embellishment at the bust can give \n","weight to the area and make it look a bit bigger. \n"," Make the most of your great legs by wearing miniskirts  with bright tights. Or, throw \n","on skinny jeans.

With this body type, it is great to wear shirts, blouses, or dresses with \n","slight V-neck shapes. \n"," Choose flared pants over straight-leg or skinny jeans to balance out your \n","wider shoulders and heavier upper body.

These styles help \n","balance out your more bottom-heavy shape. \n"," Wearing a well-fitting bra  can also enhance your bust and bring balance to \n","your shape. \n"," Pants or tights that narrow your legs, like skinny and very flared jeans, ca n \n","emphasize your bottom half even more. If you want to create more balance \n","in your figure, avoid these styles. \n"," If you want to hide your bottom half, doing glute exercises and cardio \n","might shrink butt fat .

Generally \n","speaking, oval figures are widest around the middle. You might notice that you also have the \n","following features of slender legs, a large bust and narrower hips. The key to dressing for an \n","Oval body type is to create a defined waist. When choosing clothes, silhouettes that define your \n","waist can be a great option, as they help to create shapes and lines. \n","When choosing tops for an apple shape, look for styles that define your midsection. \n","Avoid tops that are too form fitting or shapeless, structure is your best friend with oval \n","figures. We suggest choosing: \n"," Jackets  that have a belt or nipped in tailoring. Try to find styles that have a button \n","beneath your bust for the most flattering fit. \n","DRESSES FOR OVAL SHAPED BODY: \n","·   \n","Dresses with a plunging neckline. V-neck dresses and plunging styles are perfect for o val figures.  \n","·  Dresses with full, flowing skirts. Oval figures can sometimes need a little help in cr eating curves. Full \n","or flowing skirts that don ’t cling to your midsection are perfect for this, particularly if they have a belted \n","or tailored waistline. \n","·  Strapless or sleeveless dresses. Take advantage of your \n","figure by choosing strapless, sleeveless or bardot dresses. \n","  \n","Undretone  \n","First things first: what is your skin ’s “undertone, ” and how do you identify it? \n","While skin tones range from fair to dark, undertones are the cool, warm o r \n","neutral tinges within your skin tone. We like to think of it this way —your \n","skin ’s tone may vary from season to season (especially if you ’re soaking up \n","the sun on vacation) but your skin ’s undertone  never changes.  \n","There are a few simple ways to ID your skin ’s undertone. Looking at the veins \n","in your wrist is one: if your veins appear to be blue or purple, you probably \n","have a cool undertone, while if they look more green, you likely have a warm \n","undertone.  \n","You can also try the white T-shirt test. Grab a true white shirt, find a spot of \n","natural light, and hold the shirt up next to your face. In comparison to the optic \n","white, does your complexion look pink or rosy? You ’re likely cool toned. If your \n","skin looks more yellow compared to the bright white swatch, your undertone is \n","warm. \n","Now that you ’re equipped to identify your skin ’s undertone, scroll on to find \n","your favorite colors, and the hues that ’ll best complement your \n","complexion. One thing to keep in mind: there are always exceptions to the \n","rules, and the only rule we follow is this: if you feel amazing in your clothes, \n","then rules are meant to be broken!  \n","YOUR BEST REDS  \n","Red —it’s the fiery hue that inspires confidence and passion, and we ’re firm \n","believers that anyone can pull it off. It ’s all about choosing shades from the red spectrum that jive with your skin ’s undertone, whether you ’re adding a \n","bold new top to your lineup, or turning heads in an all-red-everything ‘fit. \n"," Reds for warm undertones \n","If your skin has warm undertones, similarly warm hues tend to complement \n","your skin best. Colors like brick, cherry, raspberry and crimson bel ong in your \n","closet, as they ’ll bring out the golden tones in your complexion. \n","Reds for cool undertones \n","If your skin has cooler undertones, you ’ll want to put these standout shades \n","on your radar: poppy, ruby and scarlet. Orange- and pink-tinged reds will bring \n","some warmth to your complexion —and heat up your style in no time.  \n","Blues for warm undertones  \n","While blue is a cool color, there are still shades within the spectrum that look \n","flawless against warm undertones. Hues with a little yellow in them —dark \n","turquoise, teal blue or robin ’s egg blue —will still make you look, and feel, \n","radiant.  Blues for cool undertones \n","If you ’ve got cool undertones, the world of blue is your oyster. Sapphire, \n","cobalt and ice blue are among the colors to add to your repertoire, as they ’ll \n","balance the natural rosiness in your skin. Pastels pair beautifully with cool \n","undertones, so don ’t pass up that powder blue sweater you ’ve been eyeing.  \n","Neutrals for warm undertones \n","When it comes to choosing complementary neutrals, think warm for warm and \n","cool for cool undertones. Earth colors like sand, sepia, caramel and deep \n","tonal reds will all enhance the peach or golden casts in your skin. \n","Neutrals for cool undertones \n","Cooler neutrals like taupe, nude, blush and dove gray will look soft against \n","your cool complexion. Opt for a blush sweater, which will enhance the healthy \n","pink glow of your skin, or go monochrome with an all-taupe ensemble.  \n","If You Are Warm-T oned: \n","As a golden rule (pun intended) for all of you who have warm skin undertones, always stay close to \n","nature! In other words, the colours that flatter yo ur skin the most are the ones that can be found in \n","nature's colours. This includes greens, oranges, ye llows, reds, browns, and anything in between! Let \n","nature be your palette! \n"," \n","While these colours are strong and bold, you can al ways opt for similar shades for a more subtle colou r \n","choice. Go for pink hues instead of a bright shade of red, olive instead of a loud tinge of green. So long \n","as the colours belong to the same family , they will  enhance your overall look!  \n"," \n","A note to all with warmer skin undertones, refrain from wearing colours with a blue undertone. Colours  \n","like blue or grey can easily wash your skin out and  dull your look! \n","If You Are Cool-T oned: \n","If you are under the cool skin undertone category , you have a pink or rosy undertone. Your colour \n","spectrum leans towards the ocean shades such as sky  blue, seafoam green and wintery pastelish shades like lilac, icy blue and light pinks. However , do s teer clear of colours like bright orange and yellow  as \n","they can wash you out.  \n","Colors for Warmer Skin Tones \n","LA-based fashion and celebrity stylist Philippe Uter  tells InStyle that he associates \n","warm skin tones with warm colors, like orange, yellow, or even gold. \n","He adds that bright colors also make the perfect match, while Theodora says that \n","natural earth tones such as browns, deep tonal reds, and rich shades of green look \n","great as well. \n","Colors You Might Want to Avoid \n","As far as Uter is concerned, there aren't really any colors warmer skin tones should  \n","avoid. That being said, he does suggest only wearing black if it's a \"slick and graphic \n","piece.\" \n","Your Skin Tone \n","Has a bluish undertone. This group can also range from very fair to very dark, \n","Eiseman tells InStyle . \n","Your Hair Color  \n","Ranges from very dark (blue-black or a deep brown) to light blond e. \n","Your Jewelry Preference  \n","According to Theodora, those in the cool group tend to prefer silver, rose g old, or a \n","mix of both. \n","Colors for Cooler Skin Tones \n","Cooler tones look fantastic in charcoal, cool blues, and violet, says Theodora.  \n","However, Uter adds that you might want to keep in mind that strong colors can ma ke \n","cool skin tones look paler. \"I usually love pastel colors to bring some softn ess to the \n","silhouette,\" he tells us —and also recommends adding blues and pinks, soft yellow, or \n","green to your wardrobe. \n","Colors You Might Want to Avoid  \n","Uter's biggest no-no when it comes to dressing cooler skin tones are too  bold, strong \n","colors, such as electric blue or grassy green. Eiseman warns against wearing oranges \n","and yellows. \n"," \n"]}]}]}
